          <p><h3>Mo'olelo "history, legend,tradition" </h3></p>
          <p>1,500 years ago Polynesians arrive in Hawai'i after navigating the ocean using only the stars to guide them. 1778 Capt. James Cook lands at Waiemea Bay on the island of Kauai'i, becoming the first european to make contact with the Hawaiian islands. Cook names the island chain "Sandwich Islands" after the Earl of Sandwich. A year later, Cook is killed at Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawai'i. Hawai'i Consist of 8 islands. Hawai'i (Big Island), Maui, Kahoolawe,Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai and Niihau. Immediately before Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959, it was a territory of the US, However, it had been a sovereign constitutional monarchy until 1893, when the last Queen, Lili'uokalani, was deposed by a group of American sugar planters and missionaries, with the support of the US marines. A few years after her overthrow, the islands were annexed to the US.</p>
           
          <p><h3>Ka'apuni "travel"</h3></p>
          <p>The ancient Hawaiians used canoes for fishing, traveling, and examining the shore. The single-hulled outrigger was used for nearshore fishing, and larger double hulled canoes could transport over 100 people and was propelled by sail and paddlers.</p>

          <p><h3>Kaukau "food"</h3></p>
           <p>The staple food of the hawaiians were taro and poi, breadfruit, sweet potato, bananas, taro tops and some other leafy vegetables, limu, fish and other sea foods, chicken, pig and dog. With no fire proof cooking utensils, Hawaiians managed to boil liquids by dropping hot stones into a calabash,an oval wooden bowl which contained the liquid. Thus, certain foods were prepared by steaming. Most cooking, however, was done in the imu or underground oven, using no containers of any kind. </p>
